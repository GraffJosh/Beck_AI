CS 4341 Assignment 2
Genetic search algorithms
Dependencies:
	python3-matplotlib
	python3-numpy

Purpose
This application finds the combination of given operators to compute a given endpoint from a given startpoint.

Usage
This application supports file input. Use the following format.
File input
Input files should be formatted as follows:
	Search Type -- ‘greedy’ or ‘iterative’
	Starting value -- float
	Ending value -- float
	Time limit -- truncated to integer
	Acceptable operators -- operator followed by float. Separated by newlines.

Testfile example:
greedy
5
100
2
+1.3
^6.4
-1


Append the python3 call with as many input filenames as is required.
Execution example:
	:~/$ python3 CS4341_Assignment_2.py testfile1
	:~/$ python3 CS4341_Assignment_2.py testfile1 testfile2
