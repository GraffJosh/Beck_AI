CS 4341 Assignment 1
Basic search algorithms
Purpose
This application finds the minimum number of given numeric operators to compute a given endpoint from a given startpoint. 

Usage
There are two ways to use this application, using a file input or using manual input.
File input
Input files should be formatted as follows:
	Search Type -- ‘greedy’ or ‘iterative’
	Starting value -- truncated to integer
	Ending value -- truncated to integer
	Time limit -- float values accepted
	Acceptable operators -- operator followed by integer. Separated by spaces.

Testfile example:
greedy
5
100
2.5
+1 -1 -1


Append the python3 call with as many input filenames as is required.
Execution example:
	:~/$ python3 CS4341_Assignment_1.py testfile1
	:~/$ python3 CS4341_Assignment_1.py testfile1 testfile2

Manual input
Simply follow the onscreen prompts after the following execution.
:~/$ python3 CS4341_Assignment_1.py
